# List vs Stack / Queue 

The benchmark aims to compare the performance of hashtable vs dictionary. A dictionary is internally implemented as a hashtable in .NET and provides type safety while HashTable does not. This means objects added/ retrieved to/ from a dictionary should be of specified types. Dictionary is also a generic collectection while HashTable is non-generic.
